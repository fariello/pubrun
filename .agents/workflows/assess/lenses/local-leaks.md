# Lens: Local leaks (maintainer/machine identifying info in a public artifact)

Focus the assessment on **identifying information about the author or their machine that
must not live in a public artifact**: absolute home-directory paths, usernames, other
local accounts, private sibling-repo names, hostnames, and captured session/instance ids.
The question is: **does this repo (or its shipped package, or its history) tell the world
who and where the maintainer is, or bake in paths that only resolve on one machine?**

This is distinct from adjacent lenses:
- `secrets` - credentials/keys and PII/PHI *committed* to the repo (an email address is
  covered there as PII; local-leaks reuses that, see below).
- `privacy` - how the *product* handles data subjects at runtime.
- `security` - the design habit of not hardcoding secrets.

Local leaks are the class ordinary secret scanners MISS: `/home/<you>`, a private repo
name, or a hostname has no credential shape, so gitleaks/git-secrets sail past it. This
is both a privacy leak (to every downstream user) and a correctness bug (paths that do
not resolve on their machines). See DECISIONS D92 (the first real incident) and D93.

## Lead personas

The stakeholder (privacy exposure of the maintainer), the software engineer (portable
paths, prevention), and the power user/operator running the published package.

## Do not eyeball it: run the deterministic engine

Run the packaged scanner rather than reading files by hand. It is read-only by default,
stdlib-only, and is ONE unified engine (`agent_workflows/leak_sanitizer.py`, the
`leak-sanitizer` Set) shared with the pre-commit hook and CI, so the lens cannot drift from
the gate. `aw check-local-leaks` and its broader alias `aw sanitize` are the same command:

```
aw check-local-leaks .                 # working tree (fast, default)
aw check-local-leaks . --history       # git history (bounded; add --max-commits N)
aw check-local-leaks . --wheel dist/<built>.whl   # the shipped surface
aw check-local-leaks . --warn          # ALSO surface advisory auto-derived candidates
aw check-local-leaks . --staged        # only STAGED blob content (what the hook checks)
aw check-local-leaks . --agent         # machine-parseable output for an agent caller
aw sanitize . --fix --dry-run          # preview home-style path rewrites (opt-in --fix)
```

`--fix` rewrites home-style absolute paths to `~` and is INTERACTIVE per file by default
(`--yes`/`--force` to batch, `--dry-run` to preview); identity/private-repo/session tokens
have no safe generic rewrite, so they are reported for manual editing and never auto-changed.
`--fix` is opt-in and is NOT wired into the pre-commit hook. The IP ruleset (v4/v6) is OFF by
default; enable it per repo via `ip_enabled = true` in the tracked allowlist.

Equivalent without the CLI installed: `python3 -m agent_workflows check-local-leaks .`.

Severity model the engine uses (D93, preserved through the unification):
- **fail** (fails the non-interactive gate): STRUCTURAL patterns (home paths, the
  local-checkout dir style, session ids), the curated repo allowlist misses, and the
  user-level personal hints.
- **warn** (advisory, `--warn` only): auto-derived candidates from the environment
  (`$HOME` basename, `git config user.*`, `$USER`/`$USERNAME`, hostname, sibling dir
  names). These NEVER fail CI; they are for a human to confirm here.

## What to cover

- **Shipped surface first** (highest stakes): build the wheel and scan it
  (`--wheel`). Anything identifying that ships is published to every installer and, once
  on a registry, is effectively immutable. Lead the IPD with these.
- **Working tree** and **history** (public on the forge even when not shipped): a leak
  reachable only via an old commit/tag is invisible to a tree scan; run `--history`.
- **Emails and usernames** (the interactive part): enumerate every distinct email and
  username the scan surfaces (emails are also flagged by `assess-secrets` as PII - do not
  contradict it; here the angle is author identity). Present the enumerated set to the
  human and **ask which are intended-public and which are leaks**. Record the approved
  ones (see below) so the automated gate stops re-flagging them.

## Triage (human judgment on the candidates)

1. **Intended-public identifiers** (the author email in package metadata, the public repo
   origin URL): confirm and ADD them to the repo-committed allowlist
   `.agents/local-leaks-allowlist.toml` (`allow_line_substrings = [...]`). This travels
   with the repo and keeps CI deterministic.
2. **Advisory (warn) auto-derived candidates:** confirm interactively. If a derived token
   is a real leak, add it to the fail set (a repo `fail_patterns` entry, or the operator's
   never-committed `~/.config/agent-workflows/local-leaks-hints.json` if it is machine-wide).
   If it is a false positive (a common word that happens to match a username), leave it as
   warn-only.
3. **Real leaks:** classify and route to remediation.

## Remediation to propose

1. **Abstract in tracked files:** replace absolute paths with repo-relative or placeholder
   forms; replace private repo names / usernames / hostnames with neutral descriptions or
   placeholders. Editable docs can be rewritten; historical records (executed plans,
   recovery transcripts) get a noted redaction (never a silent rewrite) - see D92.
2. **Purge from history** if the leak is in past commits (a tree scrub leaves it in
   history). Propose `git filter-repo` with a reviewed replace-map; note it rewrites
   history (force-push, collaborators re-clone) and route the decision to the human.
3. **Un-ship it:** if a leak reached a published package, note that a registry yank HIDES
   but does not ALTER the already-uploaded bytes; deletion + a clean re-release may be
   needed. Route to the human.
4. **Prevent recurrence:** the pre-commit hook + the `local-leaks` CI backstop already run
   this engine; ensure they are installed. Add confirmed-public values to the committed
   allowlist rather than weakening the patterns.

## IPD emphasis

Lead with any leak in the SHIPPED wheel (published-artifact exposure), then history, then
working tree. Never write a raw leaked value into the IPD/run record/chat beyond the
`location` + redacted snippet the engine already prints. Be explicit that history rewrites
and registry yanks are operator actions this workflow proposes but does not perform.
